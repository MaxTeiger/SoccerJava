SoccerJava Project
====

I created this project for MET CS-622 course from Boston University. 

My project would be a football team management project. It would allow its user to add / remove players to teams, add and remove teams, organize matches between teams. The user will be able to display the ranking of a league as well as the calendar of a league with past and upcoming matches.  
The user will have access to a menu at the opening of the program offering him to choose what he wants to manage (teams, matches, etc...). 

The project can be run from the class met.cs622.view.MainMenu it should open a user interface 
making it possible to interact with the application.

The application should (for the moment) implements abstract class, polymorphism, inheritance, user-defined exception(s), downcasting (or upcasting),
file I/O, Generic Methods/Class,
Serialization, Lambdas, Streams
and Database connectivity. 

This project is available on [GitHub][GitHub].
